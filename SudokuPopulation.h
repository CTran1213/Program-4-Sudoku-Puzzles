//This is the container for holding a large number of puzzle objects
//It uses a Fitness strategy to evaluate the quality of a Puzzle.
//It can "cull" Puzzles from the population (based on their fitness).
//It can use a PuzzleFactory and a Reproduction strategy to produce a new 
//generation of Puzzles from the most fit members of the old generation.
//It performs these operations when commanded by the main GeneticAlgorithm.
//The SudokuPopulation class implements all Population methods for Sudoku 
//objects, using a SudokuFitness object to accomplish its tasks.
